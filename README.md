This project is composed of two parts, separated within their own branches:

1. A Discord Bot used to integrate a plugin from my personal Minecraft server, LoreCraft. The bot can log chat messages and certain events, such as player login/logout.
2. The plugin installed on the Minecraft server, used to connect the Discord Bot to the server.
